{"name":"Khat","tagline":"An email template framework to help ease the development of HTML emails.","body":"## ![khat](https://github.com/arslanakram/khat/raw/master/logo.png \"khat\")\r\n\r\nAn email template framework to help ease the development of HTML emails.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nkhat eases the process of HTML email development by providing you with:\r\n\r\n- Grid Layouts and Components - commonly-used design patterns in emails.\r\n- A local development server with browserSync (live reload) functionality.\r\n- Fluid and Fixed HTML templates to get you started.\r\n- The ability to develop with external LESS stylesheets.\r\n- Automatic inlining of the external CSS styles in your template.\r\n- Optimized CSS & HTML by removing unused comments and selectors from your code.                               \r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nkhat uses the following to run:\r\n\r\n1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) node's package manager. To run npm please install node via [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\r\n2. [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). Please visit [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to install ruby.\r\n3. [ruby's premailer gem](https://github.com/premailer/premailer/). You can install via RubyGems package management framework for Ruby:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install premailer\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Quick start\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/arslanakram/khat.git`\r\n2. Run 'npm install' in the terminal to install npm dependencies\r\n3. Run 'gulp serve' in the terminal. This will open the 'dist' in the browser at 'http://localhost:3000' and start watching for file changes in the 'app' directory and automatically compile your html file in the 'dist' directory. As you change the html / less files in 'app' directory, it will compile the html file in the 'dist' directory and reload the browser for changes.\r\n\r\n### Directory structure\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── app\r\n│   ├── html\r\n│   │\t├── khat\r\n│   │\t│   ├── components\r\n│   │\t│   │   ├── footer.html\r\n│   │\t│   │   ├── fullwidth-image.html\r\n│   │\t│   │   ├── header-with-background-image.html\r\n│   │\t│   │   ├── social-icons.html\r\n│   │\t│   │   └── typography.html\r\n│   │   │   └── grid\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-1-column.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-2-column-fixed.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-2-column-fluid.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-3-column-fixed.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-3-column-fluid.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-4-column-fixed.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-4-column-fluid.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-one-fourth-sidebar-fixed.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-one-fourth-sidebar-fluid.html\r\n│   │\t│       ├── grid-one-third-sidebar-fixed.html\r\n│   │\t│       └── grid-one-third-sidebar-fluid.html\r\n│   │   ├── khat-fixed-with-fixed-images.html\r\n│   │   ├── khat-fixed-with-responsive-images.html\r\n│   │   ├── khat-fluid-with-fixed-images.html\r\n│   │   └── khat-fluid-with-responsive-images.html\r\n│   └── styles\r\n│    \t├── css\r\n│    \t│   └── khat.css\r\n│    \t└── less\r\n│           ├── _core\r\n│           │   ├── _mixins.less\r\n│           │   ├── _variables.less\r\n│           │   ├── grid.less\r\n│           │   ├── reset.less\r\n│           │   └── typography.less\r\n│           ├── components\r\n│           │   ├── backgrounds.less\r\n│           │   ├── buttons.less\r\n│           │   ├── footer.less\r\n│           │   ├── full-width-image.less\r\n│           │   ├── logo.less\r\n│           │   ├── pre-render.less\r\n│           │   └── social-icons.less\r\n│           └── khat.less\r\n├── dist\r\n│   ├── components\r\n│   │   ├── footer.html\r\n│   │   ├── fullwidth-image.html\r\n│   │   ├── header-with-background-image.html\r\n│   │   ├── social-icons.html\r\n│   │   └── typography.html\r\n│   ├── grid\r\n│   │   ├── grid-1-column.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-2-column-fixed.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-2-column-fluid.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-3-column-fixed.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-3-column-fluid.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-4-column-fixed.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-4-column-fluid.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-one-fourth-sidebar-fixed.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-one-fourth-sidebar-fluid.html\r\n│   │   ├── grid-one-third-sidebar-fixed.html\r\n│   │   └── grid-one-third-sidebar-fluid.html\r\n│   ├── khat-fixed-with-fixed-images.html\r\n│   ├── khat-fixed-with-responsive-images.html\r\n│   ├── khat-fluid-with-fixed-images.html\r\n│   └── khat-fluid-with-responsive-images.html\r\n├── gulpfile.js\r\n├── package.json\r\n├── LICENSE\r\n└── README.md\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `app` - source files that you should develop with.\r\n- `dist` - compiled build file suitable for distribution.
